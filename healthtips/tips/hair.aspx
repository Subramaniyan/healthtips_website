        1) Find a shampoo that lathers less. Sudsy doesn’t necessarily mean 
        clean—sometimes, it means the opposite. Shampoos that lather too much are often 
        overloaded with moisturizing products, which can leave build-up in your hair, 
        making it look and feel dirtier quicker. So opt for a sulfate-free formula.</p>
        
        <p style="position:absolute; top: 146px; left: 275px; width: 506px; height: 65px;">2) Apply products 10 minutes before you style. Whether you’re curling, straightening, or whatevering, applying product 10 minutes in advance helps it fully absorb into your strands so you get all of its benefits and more bang for your buck.</p>

        position:absolute;>3) Play hot-and-cold as you dry. When using a round brush to dry your hair in sections, start from the roots and dry all the way to the ends, letting the brush linger at the tips of your strands. Let your hair cool off like this on its own for five seconds, then repeat on another section. Alternating between heat and cool-down time helps set your style, and your blowout will have more body.</p>
